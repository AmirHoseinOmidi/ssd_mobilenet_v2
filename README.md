# Real-Time Object Detection with SSD MobileNetV2

This project uses **TensorFlow** and **OpenCV** to perform real-time object detection from a webcam using the lightweight **SSD MobileNetV2** model.

## üîç What It Does
- Captures video from your webcam
- Detects over 90 object types (like people, cars, dogs)
- Draws bounding boxes with class names and confidence scores
- Filters out detections with confidence scores below 0.5

## üß† Tech Used
- **TensorFlow** ‚Äì Loads and runs the SSD MobileNetV2 model
- **OpenCV** ‚Äì Handles webcam input and drawing boxes
- **NumPy** ‚Äì Works with image data
- **Time** ‚Äì Controls frame rate

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How It Works
1. Captures frames from the webcam
2. Resizes each frame to **320x320**
3. Converts it to a tensor and runs it through the model
4. If objects are detected:
   - Draws bounding boxes
   - Displays class names and scores (if score > 0.5)
5. Press **'q'** to stop



## ‚öôÔ∏è Running the Code

To run the real-time object detection, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3 and the necessary libraries installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy
```
Download the pre-trained SSD MobileNetV2 model from the official TensorFlow model zoo:

Pretrained Model: https://www.kaggle.com/models/tensorflow/ssd-mobilenet-v2

Extract the model file and update the model_dir variable in the code with the path to where the model is stored.

Pretrained Model: The pretrained model used in this project was obtained from the TensorFlow Object Detection Model Zoo.

## üß™ Profiling

This project includes performance profiling using Python's built-in `cProfile` and `pstats` modules.

Profiling helps analyze the program‚Äôs performance by:
- Measuring how much time is spent in each function
- Identifying slow or resource-heavy parts of the code
- Printing a summary of the top 30 most time-consuming function calls (sorted by cumulative time)

You don‚Äôt need to install anything extra ‚Äî both `cProfile` and `pstats` are included in the Python standard library.
